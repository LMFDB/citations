List of citations of the LMFDB

The file citations.bib contains BiBTeX references for papers,
including preprints, which cite the LMFDB, either as formal citations
or in the text.  The first version of this was obtain from Google
Scholar in 2016-04-18 with some manual editing.

Assuming that you have bibtex2html installed, typing "make full" will
create two html files, the list of references citations.bib and a
linked web page of the bibtex entries themselves.  Also "make lmfdb"
will make a version with no header or footer suitable for copying into
the lmfdb code repository.

The file preprints.bib contains items which used to be in
citations.bib but which have since been replaced by later versions,
for example a preprint replaced by a published paper.
